                <p>Dear Emily, happy birthday. It is once again a new year and I
                    hope this birthday and all the future ones are filled with happiness for
                    you. I know we may always complain about getting older or our memory loss
                    and back pain
                    getting worse but I also can not wait to continue growing older, seeing the
                    kind of person you grow into, and all the things you will accompish. I think
                    it is an honor to be able to be apart of your life <3 You are one of the most important people in my
                        life. You have been with me for as long as I can remember.. since we were little kids pulling
                        our hairs and biting one another (you biting mainly haahaha) to the slightly awkard middle
                        school reencounter (as we had not really grown up together) up until now (and many more to
                        come). I dont know that I have ever told you this but I genuinely believe in platonic soulmates
                        because of you. That is why- and I have said this many times before- I hope that in every
                        universe we are somehow connected and in each others lives. I can not imagine what I would do
                        without someone like yourself in my life. You are someone who I find so much comfort in, who I
                        can laugh with, you are so kind, funny, and thoughtful. All in all, you are not only mi prima
                        but you are someone who I cherish very deeply. Love you lots -Jackie </p>
